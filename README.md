# Netflix_Data_Analysis
This project explores and analyzes a Netflix dataset to gain meaningful insights about the platform’s content library, trends, and user-oriented statistics. The goal is to demonstrate practical Data Science skills — from data cleaning to visualization — while answering real-world business questions relevant to a global streaming service.
🚀 Key Objectives
✅ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and characteristics of Netflix’s catalog.
✅ Analyze movie vs. TV show trends, content rating distribution, and genre popularity.
✅ Extract insights like the most common directors, actors, countries of production, and release year trends.
✅ Visualize findings with clear plots to communicate trends and patterns.
✅ Apply basic data wrangling, feature engineering, and visualization techniques using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

🗂️ Project Steps
1️⃣ Data Collection:
Used an open Netflix dataset (e.g., Netflix Movies and TV Shows from Kaggle).

2️⃣ Data Cleaning:

Checked for null values, duplicates, inconsistent formats.

Cleaned columns like Date Added, Cast, Country, and Genres.

3️⃣ Feature Engineering:

Extracted Year Added and Month Added from the Date Added.

Split multiple genres and countries for deeper insights.

4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed content type trends (Movies vs TV Shows).

Identified top countries producing Netflix content.

Examined ratings to see age-based content availability.

Found most frequent directors and actors.

5️⃣ Visualization:

Plotted bar charts, pie charts, word clouds, and time series graphs to present insights clearly.

6️⃣ Conclusion:

Summarized trends in Netflix’s expansion and content curation strategy.
